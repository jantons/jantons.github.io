I am Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons and I are dedicated to shaping the future of human-machine interaction. I aim to develop and refine immersive technologies that bring the digital and physical worlds closer together. I aim to enhance the way people experience, learn, and communicate through innovative solutions in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR).

At the Immersive Reality Lab, I believe technology should seamlessly integrate into people's lives, offering intuitive and meaningful experiences. Whether it's redefining how industries train their workforce, expanding the possibilities of entertainment, or creating accessible tools for education, my team and I are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of immersive tech.

My interdisciplinary approach brings creative designers, engineers, and researchers together to explore new possibilities. I collaborate with industry partners, academic institutions, and diverse communities to ensure that the technology we create is impactful, inclusive, and transformative.
