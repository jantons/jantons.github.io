2010-08-01	Using ERPs for assessing the (sub) conscious perception of noise	International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology	In this paper, we investigate the use of event- related potentials (ERPs) as a quantitative measure for quality assessment of disturbed audio signals. For this purpose, we ran an EEG study (N=11) using an oddball paradigm, during which subjects were presented with the phoneme /a/, superimposed with varying degrees of signal-correlated noise. Based on this data set, we address the question to which degree the degradation of the auditory stimuli is reflected on a neural level, even if the disturbance is below the threshold of conscious perception. For those stimuli that are consciously recognized as being disturbed, we suggest the use of the amplitude and latency of the P300 component for assessing the level of disturbance. For disturbed stimuli for which the noise is not perceived consciously, we show for two subjects that a classifier based on shrinkage LDA can be applied successfully to single out stimuli, for which the noise was presumably processed subconsciously.

This chapter outlines common brain activity correlates that are known from neuroscience, gives an overview on established electrophysiological analysis methods and on the background of electroencephalography (EEG). After that an overview on study designs will be given and a practical guideline for the design of experiments using EEG in the research area of Quality of Experience (QoE) will be presented. At the end of this chapter we will close with a summary, give practical advice, and we will outline potential interesting future research topics.	Antons, J.-N., Arndt, S., Schleicher, R. & Möller, S.

2014-01-01	Evoking Emotions and Evaluating Emotional Impact	S. Möller & A. Raake (Eds.), Quality of Experience (pp.121–132). Cham, Switzerland: Springer International Publishing.	This chapter gives an overview for Quality of Experience (QoE) practitioners on common setups in emotion research using audio (sounds), visual (pictures) and audiovisual (video clips) stimulus material to induce emotions. After presenting available databases for the different modalities, methods for subsequent as well as continuous self-assessment are discussed. Next to self-assessment, analysis of accompanying physiological changes is a common means to evaluate emotional responses. Here, typical measures of peripheral physiology are summarized. Finally, practical advices for including material with emotional content and recording physiological signals in experiments on audiovisual quality are given, and future research directions are outlined.

2015-01-01	Neural Correlates of Quality Perception for Complex Speech Signals	Springer International Publishing	This book interconnects two essential disciplines to study the perception of speech: Neuroscience and Quality of Experience, which to date have rarely been used together for the purposes of research on speech quality perception. In five key experiments, the book demonstrates the application of standard clinical methods in neurophysiology on the one hand, and of methods used in fields of research concerned with speech quality perception on the other. Using this combination, the book shows that speech stimuli with different lengths and different quality impairments are accompanied by physiological reactions related to quality variations, e.g., a positive peak in an event-related potential. Furthermore, it demonstrates that – in most cases – quality impairment intensity has an impact on the intensity of physiological reactions.	Antons, J. N. (2015).

2019-01-01	Finding critical features for predicting quality of life in tablet-based serious games for dementia	Quality and User Experience	While the number of dementia cases is steadily increasing, as of today no medication has been developed to cure its underlying causes. Instead, the focus in treatment has shifted to improve quality of life (QoL) for people with dementia (PwD). To this end, some non-pharmacological treatments such as exercising, socializing, and playing games have received increasing attention. PflegeTab is a tablet-based application developed for this purpose. It includes a number of services such as cognitive training games, everyday activity training games, emotional applications, and a biographical picture album. In the present paper, we explore the possibility of QoL prediction for PwD using data collected while nursing home residents played games in PflegeTab (N=81). Using features generated from the data and applying linear discriminant analysis for classification, our approach obtained an average accuracy of 74.80% on predicting QoL ratings when measured by Monte Carlo cross-validation. Furthermore, this paper investigates which features were dominant for the classification (prominent features were e.g. time needed for task completion) and briefly discusses how the results might be utilized for managing general QoL of PwD.
