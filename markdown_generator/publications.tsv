2015-01-01	Neural Correlates of Quality Perception for Complex Speech Signals	books	Springer	This book interconnects two essential disciplines to study the perception of speech: Neuroscience and Quality of Experience, which to date have rarely been used together for the purposes of research on speech quality perception. In five key experiments, the book demonstrates the application of standard clinical methods in neurophysiology on the one hand and of methods used in fields of research concerned with speech quality perception on the other. Using this combination, the book shows that speech stimuli with different lengths and different quality impairments are accompanied by physiological reactions related to quality variations, e.g., a positive peak in an event-related potential. Furthermore, it demonstrates that – in most cases – quality impairment intensity has an impact on the intensity of physiological reactions.	Antons, J.-N. (2015).

2014-01-01	Evoking Emotions and Evaluating Emotional Impact	bookchapters	Springer	This chapter gives an overview for Quality of Experience (QoE) practitioners on common setups in emotion research using audio (sounds), visual (pictures) and audiovisual (video clips) stimulus material to induce emotions. After presenting available databases for the different modalities, methods for subsequent as well as continuous self-assessment are discussed. Next to self-assessment, analysis of accompanying physiological changes is a common means to evaluate emotional responses. Here, typical measures of peripheral physiology are summarized. Finally, practical advices for including material with emotional content and recording physiological signals in experiments on audiovisual quality are given, and future research directions are outlined.

2024-07-01	Außerhäusliche Mobilität von Personen ab 75 Jahren im ländlichen Raum. Ergebnisse aus einer GPS-Studie	manuscripts	Bundesgesundheitsblatt	Out-of-home mobility, defined as active and passive movement through external environments, is a resource for autonomy, quality of life, and self-realization in older age. Various factors influence out-of-home mobility, primarily studied in urban settings. The study aims to examine associated factors in a study population aged 75 and above in rural areas. Baseline data from the MOBILE trial involving 212 participants aged 75 and above and collected between June 2021 and October 2022 were analyzed. Out-of-home mobility was measured temporally as time out of home (TOH) and spatially as convex hull (CHull) using GPS over seven days. Mixed models considered outpatient care parameters as well as personal, social, and environmental factors along with covariates such as age and gender. Participants in the MOBILE study (average age 81.5; SD: 4.1; 56.1% female) exhibited average out-of-home mobility of TOH: 319.3 min (SD: 196.3). Significant associations were found for age, social network, living arrangement, health literacy, sidewalk quality , green space ratio, outpatient care utilization, and active driving. Previously known multifactorial associations related to objectively measured out-of-home mobility in old age could be confirmed in rural areas. Novel and relevant for research and practice is the significant correlation between out-of-home mobility and outpatient care utilization.	Haeger, C., Mümken, S. A., Spang, R.

2024-03-15	Situativität, Funktionalität und Vertrauen: Ergebnisse einer szenariobasierten Interviewstudie zur Erklärbarkeit von KI in der Medizin	manuscripts	 Journal for Technology Assessment in Theory and Practice	A central requirement for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is its explainability, i. e., the provision of addressee-oriented information about its functioning. This leads to the question of how socially adequate explainability can be designed. To identify evaluation factors, we interviewed healthcare stakeholders about two scenarios: diagnostics and documentation. The scenarios vary the influence that an AI system has on decision-making through the interaction design and the amount of data processed. We present key evaluation factors for explainability at the interactional and procedural levels. Explainability must not interfere situationally in the doctor-patient conversation and question the professional role. At the same time, explainability functionally legitimizes an AI system as a second opinion and is central to building trust. A virtual embodiment of the AI system is advantageous for language-based explanations.	Marquardt, M., Graf, P., Jansen, E., Hillmann, S., & Voigt-Antons, J.-N. (2024).

2024-10-10	Digital Eyes: Social Implications of XR EyeSight	conferences	 30th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology	The EyeSight feature, introduced with the new Apple Vision Pro XR headset, promises to revolutionize user interaction by simulating real human eye expressions on a digital display. This feature could enhance XR devices’ social acceptability and social presence when communicating with others outside the XR experience. In this pilot study, we explore the implications of the EyeSight feature by examining social acceptability, social presence, emotional responses, and technology acceptance. Eight participants engaged in conversational tasks in three conditions to contrast experiencing the Apple Vision Pro with EyeSight, the Meta Quest 3 as a reference XR headset, and a face-to-face setting. Our preliminary findings indicate that while the EyeSight feature improves perceptions of social presence and acceptability compared to the reference headsets, it does not match the social connectivity of direct human interactions.

2024-10-10	Single Vs Dual: Influence of the Number of Displays on User Experience Within Virtually Embodied Conversational Systems	conferences	 30th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology	The current research evaluates user experience and preference when interacting with a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) healthcare application displayed on a single tablet in comparison to interaction with the same application distributed across two tablets. We conducted a within-subject user study with 43 participants who engaged with and rated the usability of our system and participated in a post-experiment interview to collect subjective data. Our findings showed significantly higher usability and higher pragmatic quality ratings for the single tablet condition. However, some users attribute a higher level of presence to the avatar and prefer it to be placed on a second tablet.	Ashrafi, N., Hinzmann, S.
