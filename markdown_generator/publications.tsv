2015-03-15	Neural Correlates of Quality Perception for Complex Speech Signals	books	Springer	This book interconnects two essential disciplines to study the perception of speech: Neuroscience and Quality of Experience, which to date have rarely been used together for the purposes of research on speech quality perception. In five key experiments, the book demonstrates the application of standard clinical methods in neurophysiology on the one hand and of methods used in fields of research concerned with speech quality perception on the other. Using this combination, the book shows that speech stimuli with different lengths and different quality impairments are accompanied by physiological reactions related to quality variations, e.g., a positive peak in an event-related potential. Furthermore, it demonstrates that – in most cases – quality impairment intensity has an impact on the intensity of physiological reactions.	Antons, J.-N.	Antons, J.-N. (2015).

2024-07-01	Außerhäusliche Mobilität von Personen ab 75 Jahren im ländlichen Raum. Ergebnisse aus einer GPS-Studie	manuscripts	Bundesgesundheitsblatt	Out-of-home mobility, defined as active and passive movement through external environments, is a resource for autonomy, quality of life, and self-realization in older age. Various factors influence out-of-home mobility, primarily studied in urban settings. The study aims to examine associated factors in a study population aged 75 and above in rural areas. Baseline data from the MOBILE trial involving 212 participants aged 75 and above and collected between June 2021 and October 2022 were analyzed. Out-of-home mobility was measured temporally as time out of home (TOH) and spatially as convex hull (CHull) using GPS over seven days. Mixed models considered outpatient care parameters as well as personal, social, and environmental factors along with covariates such as age and gender. Participants in the MOBILE study (average age 81.5; SD: 4.1; 56.1% female) exhibited average out-of-home mobility of TOH: 319.3 min (SD: 196.3). Significant associations were found for age, social network, living arrangement, health literacy, sidewalk quality , green space ratio, outpatient care utilization, and active driving. Previously known multifactorial associations related to objectively measured out-of-home mobility in old age could be confirmed in rural areas. Novel and relevant for research and practice is the significant correlation between out-of-home mobility and outpatient care utilization.	Haeger, C., Mümken, S. A., Spang, R.

2024-03-15	Situativität, Funktionalität und Vertrauen: Ergebnisse einer szenariobasierten Interviewstudie zur Erklärbarkeit von KI in der Medizin	manuscripts	 Journal for Technology Assessment in Theory and Practice	A central requirement for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is its explainability, i. e., the provision of addressee-oriented information about its functioning. This leads to the question of how socially adequate explainability can be designed. To identify evaluation factors, we interviewed healthcare stakeholders about two scenarios: diagnostics and documentation. The scenarios vary the influence that an AI system has on decision-making through the interaction design and the amount of data processed. We present key evaluation factors for explainability at the interactional and procedural levels. Explainability must not interfere situationally in the doctor-patient conversation and question the professional role. At the same time, explainability functionally legitimizes an AI system as a second opinion and is central to building trust. A virtual embodiment of the AI system is advantageous for language-based explanations.	Marquardt, M., Graf, P., Jansen, E., Hillmann, S., & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2023-12-01	Effectiveness of a tablet-based intervention for people living with dementia in primary care – A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial	manuscripts	 International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry	Primary care physicians (PCP) play a key role in the care of people living with dementia. However, the implementation and practicability of the German S3 Dementia Guideline in primary care remain unclear. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate an intervention for improving guideline-based dementia care in primary care. A two-arm, 9-month follow-up cluster-randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. 28 primary care practices in Berlin and the surrounding area in Germany. A total of N = 28 PCP, N = 91 people living with dementia, and N = 88 informal caregivers participated in the trial. A tablet-based intervention to improve adherence to the German S3 Dementia Guideline in primary care was compared to a control group (care as usual plus a handbook on dementia). MeasurementsAdherence to dementia guideline (primary outcome) was measured on PCP’ (23 items) and informal caregivers' level (19 items) with a self-developed checklist. Secondary outcomes (quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, activities of daily living, general health status, depression, and caregiver burden) were measured with standardized assessments. Also, post-hoc per-protocol analyses were conducted. No differences in guideline adherence between the intervention and the control group were observed. Further, no significant impact of the intervention on secondary outcomes was detected. The DemTab Study did not improve self-reported guideline adherence in PCP. However, important implementation barriers such as lack of interoperability and low applicability of existing German S3 Dementia Guideline in the primary care setting were identified and are being discussed.

2023-05-04	Effects of User Factors on User Experience in Virtual Reality - Age, Gender, and VR Experience as Influencing Factors for VR Exergames	manuscripts	 Quality and User Experience	As virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing in past years, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast-developing areas in VR is exergaming, a combination of physical exercise and a game. VR exergames that aim to engage people in physical activity should look and feel good for users regardless of their age, gender, or their previous VR experience with similar technologies. However, recent studies showed that those factors are influencing the user experience (UX) with virtual reality. Building on top of the initial study that has reported on the effect of human influencing factors for exergaming, with this work, we investigated the influence of user parameters (such as age, gender, and previous VR experience) on their motivation for sports and VR exergaming. The study was done using a crowdsourcing platform to recruit a diverse set of participants, with the aim to explore how different user factors are connected to sports motivation. Results show significant differences in the user’s sports motivation and affinity for technology interaction depending on the age group, gender, previous experience with VR, their weekly exercise routine, and how much money they spend on sports yearly.

2023-03-02	Smartphone Global Positioning System–Based System to Assess Mobility in Health Research: Development, Accuracy, and Usability Study	manuscripts	JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies	As global positioning system (GPS) measurement is getting more precise and affordable, health researchers can now objectively measure mobility using GPS sensors. Available systems, however, often lack data security and means of adaptation and often rely on a permanent internet connection. To overcome these issues, we aimed to develop and test an easy-to-use, easy-to-adapt, and offline working app using smartphone sensors (GPS and accelerometry) for the quantification of mobility parameters. An Android app, a server backend, and a specialized analysis pipeline have been developed (development substudy). Parameters of mobility by the study team members were extracted from the recorded GPS data using existing and newly developed algorithms. Test measurements were performed with participants to complete accuracy and reliability tests (accuracy substudy). Usability was examined by interviewing community-dwelling older adults after 1 week of device use, followed by an iterative app design process (usability substudy). The study protocol and the software toolchain worked reliably and accurately, even under suboptimal conditions, such as narrow streets and rural areas. The developed algorithms had high accuracy (97.4% correctness, F1-score=0.975) in distinguishing dwelling periods from moving intervals. The accuracy of the stop/trip classification is fundamental to second-order analyses such as the time out of home, as they rely on a precise discrimination between the 2 classes. The usability of the app and the study protocol was piloted with older adults, which showed low barriers and easy implementation into daily routines. Based on accuracy analyses and users’ experience with the proposed system for GPS assessments, the developed algorithm showed great potential for app-based estimation of mobility in diverse health research contexts, including mobility patterns of community-dwelling older adults living in rural areas.

2023-01-05	Real-time affect detection in virtual reality: a technique based on a three-dimensional model of affect and EEG signals	manuscripts	Front. Virtual Real.	This manuscript explores the development of a technique for detecting the affective states of Virtual Reality (VR) users in real-time. The technique was tested with data from an experiment where 18 participants observed 16 videos with emotional content inside a VR home theater, while their electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded. Participants evaluated their affective response toward the videos in terms of a three-dimensional model of affect. Two variants of the technique were analyzed. The difference between both variants was the method used for feature selection. In the first variant, features extracted from the EEG signals were selected using Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) models. In the second variant, features were selected using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV). Random forest was used in both variants to build the classification models. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores were obtained by cross-validation. An ANOVA was conducted to compare the accuracy of the models built in each variant. The results indicate that the feature selection method does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of the classification models. Therefore, both variations (LME and RFECV) seem equally reliable for detecting affective states of VR users. The mean accuracy of the classification models was between 87% and 93%.

2021-06-29	A tablet-based intervention for activating nursing home residents with dementia: results from a cluster-randomized controlled trial	manuscripts	International psychogeriatrics	To investigate global and momentary effects of a tablet-based non-pharmacological intervention for nursing home residents living with dementia. Cluster-randomized controlled trial. Ten nursing homes in Germany were randomly allocated to the tablet-based intervention (TBI, 5 units) or conventional activity sessions (CAS, 5 units). N = 162 residents with dementia. Participants received regular TBI (n = 80) with stimulating activities developed to engage people with dementia or CAS (n = 82) for 8 weeks. Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-I, primary outcome), Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease scale, QUALIDEM scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale, and psychotropic medication (secondary outcomes). Momentary quality of life was assessed before and after each activity session. Participants and staff were blinded until the collection of baseline data was completed. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Levels of apathy decreased slightly in both groups (mean decrease in AES-I of .61 points, 95% CI −3.54, 2.33 for TBI and .36 points, 95% CI −3.27, 2.55 for CAS). Group difference in change of apathy was not statistically significant (β = .25; 95% CI 3.89, 4.38, p = .91). This corresponds to a standardized effect size (Cohen’s d) of .02. A reduction of psychotropic medication was found for TBI compared to CAS. Further analyses revealed a post-intervention improvement in QUALIDEM scores across both groups and short-term improvements of momentary quality of life in the CAS group. Our findings suggest that interventions involving tailored activities have a beneficial impact on global and momentary quality of life in nursing home residents with dementia. Although we found no clear advantage of TBI compared to CAS, tablet computers can support delivery of non-pharmacological interventions in nursing homes and facilitate regular assessments of fluctuating momentary states.

2021-12-18	Dementia care and the role of guideline adherence in primary care: cross-sectional findings from the DemTab study	manuscripts	BMC Geriatr	General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the care of people with dementia (PwD). However, the role of the German Dementia Guideline in primary care remains unclear. The main objective of the present study was to examine the role of guideline-based dementia care in general practices. A cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from the DemTab study was conducted. Descriptive analyses of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics for GPs (N=28) and PwD (N=91) were conducted. Adherence to the German Dementia Guideline of GPs was measured at the level of PwD. Linear Mixed Models were used to analyze the associations between adherence to the German Dementia Guideline and GP factors at individual (age, years of experience as a GP, frequency of utilization of guideline, perceived usefulness of guideline) and structural (type of practice, total number of patients seen by a participating GP, and total number of PwD seen by a participating GP) levels as well as between adherence to the German Dementia Guideline and PwD’s quality of life. Self-reported overall adherence of GPs was on average 71% (SD=19.4, range: 25–100). Adherence to specific recommendations varied widely (from 19.2 to 95.3%) and the majority of GPs (79.1%) reported the guideline as only partially or somewhat helpful. Further, we found lower adherence to be significantly associated with higher numbers of patients (γ10=−.58, CI=−10.97, −0.19, =.04). No association between adherence to the guideline and PwD’s quality of life was found (γ10=−.86, CI=−4.18, 2.47, p=.61). The present study examined the role of adherence to the German Dementia Guideline recommendations in primary care. Overall, GPs reported high levels of adherence. However, major differences across guideline recommendations were found. Findings highlight the importance of guidelines for the provision of care. Dementia guidelines for GPs need to be better tailored and addressed. Further, structural changes such as more time for PwD may contribute to a sustainable change of dementia care in primary care.

2024-10-10	Digital Eyes: Social Implications of XR EyeSight	conferences	 30th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology	The EyeSight feature, introduced with the new Apple Vision Pro XR headset, promises to revolutionize user interaction by simulating real human eye expressions on a digital display. This feature could enhance XR devices’ social acceptability and social presence when communicating with others outside the XR experience. In this pilot study, we explore the implications of the EyeSight feature by examining social acceptability, social presence, emotional responses, and technology acceptance. Eight participants engaged in conversational tasks in three conditions to contrast experiencing the Apple Vision Pro with EyeSight, the Meta Quest 3 as a reference XR headset, and a face-to-face setting. Our preliminary findings indicate that while the EyeSight feature improves perceptions of social presence and acceptability compared to the reference headsets, it does not match the social connectivity of direct human interactions.
