excerpt: ' We present a structured literature survey of User Experience (UX) dimensions and influencing factors in authentication re search. The survey is based on authentication papers presented between 2010 and 2015 on the major human computer interaction (HCI) and usable privacy and security (UPS) venues. 19% of the found papers include UX topics. Those papers show that there is a variety of ways how authentication research can profit from UX. Nevertheless, UX is often rather a by-product and not recognized as a field of study. We further discuss opportunities and challenges of including UX in authentication research.'

 We present a structured literature survey of User Experience (UX) dimensions and influencing factors in authentication re search. The survey is based on authentication papers presented between 2010 and 2015 on the major human computer interaction (HCI) and usable privacy and security (UPS) venues. 19% of the found papers include UX topics. Those papers show that there is a variety of ways how authentication research can profit from UX. Nevertheless, UX is often rather a by-product and not recognized as a field of study. We further discuss opportunities and challenges of including UX in authentication research.
