excerpt: 'Physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) have been successfully introduced to the area of quality of experience. Most of these studies used short stimuli, and showed significant differences in the EEG signal between high quality and low quality conditions. The effect of longer low quality sequences, and how these affect the cognitive state, has not been studied extensively yet. The current paper reports on a study using longer audiovisual material and distorting audio as well as video. First results investigate whether the change in cognitive state can also be captured using subjective self-reports on the state of fatigue.'

Physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) have been successfully introduced to the area of quality of experience. Most of these studies used short stimuli, and showed significant differences in the EEG signal between high quality and low quality conditions. The effect of longer low quality sequences, and how these affect the cognitive state, has not been studied extensively yet. The current paper reports on a study using longer audiovisual material and distorting audio as well as video. First results investigate whether the change in cognitive state can also be captured using subjective self-reports on the state of fatigue.
