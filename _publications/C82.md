excerpt: 'The EyeSight feature, introduced with the new Apple Vision Pro XR headset, promises to revolutionize user interaction by simulating real human eye expressions on a digital display. This feature could enhance XR devices’ social acceptability and social presence when communicating with others outside the XR experience. In this pilot study, we explore the implications of the EyeSight feature by examining social acceptability, social presence, emotional responses, and technology acceptance. Eight participants engaged in conversational tasks in three conditions to contrast experiencing the Apple Vision Pro with EyeSight, the Meta Quest 3 as a reference XR headset, and a face-to-face setting. Our preliminary findings indicate that while the EyeSight feature improves perceptions of social presence and acceptability compared to the reference headsets, it does not match the social connectivity of direct human interactions.'

The EyeSight feature, introduced with the new Apple Vision Pro XR headset, promises to revolutionize user interaction by simulating real human eye expressions on a digital display. This feature could enhance XR devices’ social acceptability and social presence when communicating with others outside the XR experience. In this pilot study, we explore the implications of the EyeSight feature by examining social acceptability, social presence, emotional responses, and technology acceptance. Eight participants engaged in conversational tasks in three conditions to contrast experiencing the Apple Vision Pro with EyeSight, the Meta Quest 3 as a reference XR headset, and a face-to-face setting. Our preliminary findings indicate that while the EyeSight feature improves perceptions of social presence and acceptability compared to the reference headsets, it does not match the social connectivity of direct human interactions.
