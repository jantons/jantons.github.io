excerpt: 'Being engaged with real-world tasks -- when hands are busy -- also means not being able to use mobile devices. Trying to overcome this problem we present NeuroPad, an iPad-application that connects a commercially available low-cost neuro headset with an iPad. The read physiological signals are used for controlling different functionalities in a touchless manner. The implemented use-cases include simple interactions with a virtual toy, a browser &quot;boss button&quot; activated by eye winks, and head movements to control a music player. The prototype intends to exemplify the usage of such interfaces as an additional input modality in the context of mobility beyond a mere gaming purpose, while pointing out limitations of the current device like the limited data quality.'

Being engaged with real-world tasks -- when hands are busy -- also means not being able to use mobile devices. Trying to overcome this problem we present NeuroPad, an iPad-application that connects a commercially available low-cost neuro headset with an iPad. The read physiological signals are used for controlling different functionalities in a touchless manner. The implemented use-cases include simple interactions with a virtual toy, a browser &quot;boss button&quot; activated by eye winks, and head movements to control a music player. The prototype intends to exemplify the usage of such interfaces as an additional input modality in the context of mobility beyond a mere gaming purpose, while pointing out limitations of the current device like the limited data quality.
