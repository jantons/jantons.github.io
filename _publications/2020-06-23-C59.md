excerpt: 'Virtual Reality (VR) has an increasing impact on the market in many fields, from education and medicine to engineering and entertainment, by creating different applications that replicate or in the case of augmentation enhance real-life scenarios. Intending to present realistic environments, VR applications are including text that we are surrounded by every day. However, text can only add value to the virtual environment if it is designed and created in such a way that users can comfortably read it. With the aim to explore what values for text parameters users find comfortable while reading in virtual reality, a study was conducted allowing participants to manipulate text parameters such as font size, distance, and contrast. Therefore two different standalone virtual reality devices were used, Oculus Go and Quest, together with three different text samples: Short (2 words), medium (21 words), and long (51 words). Participants had the task of setting text parameters to the best and worst possible value. Additionally, participants were asked to rate their experience of reading in virtual reality. Results report mean values for angular size (the combination of distance and font size) and color contrast depending on the different device used as well as the varying text length, for both tasks. Significant differences were found for values of angular size, depending on the length of the displayed text. However, different device types had no significant influence on text parameters but on the experiences reported using the self-assessment manikin (SAM) scale.'
