excerpt: 'Connected Services are innovative, mostly web-based features of state-of-the-art cars that offer the user a broad range of entertainment, communication, or navigation functionalities. The trend towards connectivity and the accompanying customer expectations can be seen as one of the driving forces for the automotive industry’s rapid transformation. Car manufacturers can achieve a competitive advantage only through an extensive service portfolio coupled with great user experience, which is expressed through the fulfillment of underlying customer needs. In this paper, a scoring model for evaluating the user experience of Connected Services based on need structures was designed and tested on ten different cars. A general impression of the user experience can be drawn by focusing on need structures. In the future, this can be translated into product requirements which may lead to more satisfied customers.'

Car manufacturers can achieve a competitive advantage only through an extensive service portfolio coupled with great user experience, which is expressed through the fulfillment of underlying customer needs.
