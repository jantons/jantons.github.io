excerpt: 'Background: Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) could be useful for delivering non-pharmacological therapies (NPTs) for dementia in nursing home settings. Aims: To identify technology-related expectations and inhibitions of healthcare professionals associated with the intention to use ICT-based NPTs. Design: Cross-sectional multi-method survey. Methods: N = 205 healthcare professionals completed a quantitative survey on usage and attitudes towards ICTs. Additionally, N = 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results: Participants were classified as intenders to use ICTs (53%), non-intenders (14%) or ambivalent (32%). A MANCOVA revealed higher perceived usefulness for intenders compared to non-intenders and ambivalent healthcare professionals (V =.28, F(12, 292)= 3.94, p <.001). Qualitative interviews revealed generally high acceptance of ICTs in the workplace. Furthermore, benefits for residents emerged as a key requirement. Conclusion: Staff trainings should stress specific benefits for residents and healthcare professionals to facilitate successful implementation and acceptance of ICTs in nursing home settings.'
