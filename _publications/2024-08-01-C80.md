excerpt: 'This study will investigate the user experience while interacting with highly photorealistic virtual job interviewer avatars in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and on a 2D screen. Having a precise speech recognition mechanism, our virtual character performs a mock-up software engineering job interview to adequately immerse the user in a life-like scenario. To evaluate the efficiency of our system, we measure factors such as the provoked level of anxiety, social presence, self-esteem, and intrinsic motivation. This research is a work in progress with a prospective within-subject user study including approximately 40 participants. All users will engage with three job interview conditions (VR, AR, and desktop) and provide their feedback. Additionally, users&apos; bio-physical responses will be collected using a biosensor to measure the level of anxiety during the job interview.'

This study will investigate the user experience while interacting with highly photorealistic virtual job interviewer avatars in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and on a 2D screen. Having a precise speech recognition mechanism, our virtual character performs a mock-up software engineering job interview to adequately immerse the user in a life-like scenario. To evaluate the efficiency of our system, we measure factors such as the provoked level of anxiety, social presence, self-esteem, and intrinsic motivation. This research is a work in progress with a prospective within-subject user study including approximately 40 participants. All users will engage with three job interview conditions (VR, AR, and desktop) and provide their feedback. Additionally, users&apos; bio-physical responses will be collected using a biosensor to measure the level of anxiety during the job interview.
