excerpt: 'Augmented Reality (AR) applications have been widely investigated over the past decades, however, due to the simultaneous advancements in technology, the research has to be constantly evolving, too.Specifically, if looking at aspects that influence User Experience (UX) and Usability, newer technologies in AR-hardware, as well as in evaluation methods, offer promising features that could have a positive influence but might also uncover new challenges.The following paper is going to propose a prototype for the assessment of emotional responses to provided stimuli with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to be integrated within an AR application. For that, the first important aspects of AR will be introduced, defined, and at times complemented and compared with known concepts from Virtual Reality.After assessing the current state-of-the-art by investigating related literature, the motivation behind an integrated approach will be explained in more detail and the implementation of the SAM prototype with the UI design platform Figma will be introduced. Results from the conducted user study will provide valuable insight into how the three-dimensional SAM was received and consider the opportunities and limitations of the implemented design.'
