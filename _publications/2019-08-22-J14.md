excerpt: 'Most people with dementia (PwD) are treated on an outpatient basis, predominantly by general practitioners (GPs). This article provides a detailed protocol of a study aimed at developing and evaluating a tablet-based intervention to improve outpatient dementia care by fostering guideline-based treatment. A cluster-randomized controlled trial with an intervention group (tablet-based intervention) and a control group (treatment as usual plus information handbook) will be conducted. Clusters will be randomized at GP level. Primary outcome is defined as adherence to dementia guideline recommendations after 9 months. Secondary outcomes include various health outcomes assessed in PwD (e.g., quality of life) and informal caregivers (e.g., caregiver burden). Outcomes will be analyzed by an intention-to-treat analysis and using mixed models.'
