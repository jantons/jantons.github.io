excerpt: 'Immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have significant potential in the therapeutic field. They can support older people, individuals with cognitive disorders and other types of conditions such as fluency disorders or phobias. This article presents three examples of VR applications with three different objectives and end users. The first example is a VR system for assessing mild cognitive impairment in older people. The second example presents a VR system used to train people with fluency disorders. The third example presents a VR system for exposure therapy for patients with canine phobia.'

Immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have significant potential in the therapeutic field. They can support older people, individuals with cognitive disorders and other types of conditions such as fluency disorders or phobias. This article presents three examples of VR applications with three different objectives and end users. The first example is a VR system for assessing mild cognitive impairment in older people. The second example presents a VR system used to train people with fluency disorders. The third example presents a VR system for exposure therapy for patients with canine phobia.
