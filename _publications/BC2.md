excerpt: 'This chapter outlines common brain activity correlates that are known from neuroscience, gives an overview on established electrophysiological analysis methods and on the background of electroencephalography (EEG). After that an overview on study designs will be given and a practical guideline for the design of experiments using EEG in the research area of Quality of Experience (QoE) will be presented. At the end of this chapter we will close with a summary, give practical advice, and we will outline potential interesting future research topics.'

This chapter outlines common brain activity correlates that are known from neuroscience, gives an overview on established electrophysiological analysis methods and on the background of electroencephalography (EEG). After that an overview on study designs will be given and a practical guideline for the design of experiments using EEG in the research area of Quality of Experience (QoE) will be presented. At the end of this chapter we will close with a summary, give practical advice, and we will outline potential interesting future research topics.
