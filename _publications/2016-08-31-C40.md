excerpt: 'This paper presents an innovative approach to the optimization of multimedia content delivery for future data intensive services, featuring an eye-gaze based paradigm for mobile video provision. The proposed solution uses real-time eyegaze information, collected by connected eye-trackers, to provide high resolution in the portion of a video frame corresponding to the central part of a user’s field of view and lower quality in the areas corresponding to the user’s peripheral vision. This approach brings new optimization opportunities, leading to significant reduction in terms of network and device resources needed to deliver high quality experience to the users. The initial results showed potential bandwidth savings on the order of 60%, while maintaining high levels of user perceived video quality. Relevant areas of application include head mounted displays for mobile virtual and augmented reality, where substantial resource consumption savings are anticipated due to their high screen resolutions. The paper also introduces and discusses few architectural embodiments as well as additional services enabled by this technology. The main focus is on utilizing the vast amount of eye-gaze information, accumulated during content provision, to build representative models for individual users’ attention and content consumption behaviors.'
