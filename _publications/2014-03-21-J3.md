excerpt: 'Using less bandwidth on the one hand and delivering high quality content on the other hand is one of the big goals for video service providers. Standardized rating tests are commonly used to quantify audiovisual quality. In order to better understand the neuronal processes underlying these quality ratings physiological measures may provide insights. This paper shows results of a series of studies using a physiological measurement, namely electroencephalography (EEG), combined with standard rating methods. The experiments follow an incremental approach in stimuli selection, ranging from purely visual to audiovisual stimuli. Results show that EEG is a feasible complement measurement technique to assess audiovisual quality as we achieve high correlation values between subjective and physiological data consistently through all experiments.'

Using less bandwidth on the one hand and delivering high quality content on the other hand is one of the big goals for video service providers. Standardized rating tests are commonly used to quantify audiovisual quality. In order to better understand the neuronal processes underlying these quality ratings physiological measures may provide insights. This paper shows results of a series of studies using a physiological measurement, namely electroencephalography (EEG), combined with standard rating methods. The experiments follow an incremental approach in stimuli selection, ranging from purely visual to audiovisual stimuli. Results show that EEG is a feasible complement measurement technique to assess audiovisual quality as we achieve high correlation values between subjective and physiological data consistently through all experiments.
