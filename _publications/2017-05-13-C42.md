excerpt: 'In this work a first attempt is made to model user experience ratings with recordings of touch interactions. To measure the user experience the AttrakDiff Mini questionnaire is used providing three quality dimensions: pragmatic quality, hedonic quality and attractiveness. The feature selection for linear models shows that it is possible to predict the pragmatic quality for a test set with an  of up to 0.64. The hedonic quality and attractiveness, however, seem not to be reflected in these touch interactions in a linear way. Still, the results from this work constitute a promising direction for future research on assessing or even optimizing the user experience for apps automatically in real time.'

In this work a first attempt is made to model user experience ratings with recordings of touch interactions. To measure the user experience the AttrakDiff Mini questionnaire is used providing three quality dimensions: pragmatic quality, hedonic quality and attractiveness. The feature selection for linear models shows that it is possible to predict the pragmatic quality for a test set with an  of up to 0.64. The hedonic quality and attractiveness, however, seem not to be reflected in these touch interactions in a linear way. Still, the results from this work constitute a promising direction for future research on assessing or even optimizing the user experience for apps automatically in real time.
