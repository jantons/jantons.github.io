excerpt: 'The subjective evaluation of video quality mostly relies on opinion tests in which test participants judge perceived quality on rating scales. However, these methods provide limited insight how the quality judgments are being formed in the brain. In past studies we showed the general feasibility to complement opinion tests with physiological measures, as the electroencephalography (EEG), for pure video and audio experiments. To establish EEG as a reliable complement measurement method in standard quality rating tests, the next step is to validate the method in the audiovisual domain. For this purpose we conducted an experiment using audiovisual stimuli and degraded these in both modalities. We show that the more degraded a video is the earlier and higher the P300 amplitude is rising. In addition, the peak amplitudes are highly correlated with the audiovisual Mean Opinion Score (MOS).'
