excerpt: 'Video quality has turned out to be a crucial aspect of multimodal transmission services. Most common video quality tests rely on a conscious judgment of test participants reflecting their internal quality perception. But it is not completely clear how this conscious rating is formed, neither in the auditory nor in the visual domain. Initial audio tests with Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that EEG recordings can be used as a sensitive and non-intrusive method for quality assessment. In this paper we conducted first experiments of pure video quality tests with EEG to complement this approach in the visual domain. One of the goals for this experiment was to show that there is a different pattern in the EEG data for cases with no distortion compared to cases when there was a distortion and the subject recognized this in the subjective test.'

Video quality has turned out to be a crucial aspect of multimodal transmission services. Most common video quality tests rely on a conscious judgment of test participants reflecting their internal quality perception. But it is not completely clear how this conscious rating is formed, neither in the auditory nor in the visual domain. Initial audio tests with Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that EEG recordings can be used as a sensitive and non-intrusive method for quality assessment. In this paper we conducted first experiments of pure video quality tests with EEG to complement this approach in the visual domain. One of the goals for this experiment was to show that there is a different pattern in the EEG data for cases with no distortion compared to cases when there was a distortion and the subject recognized this in the subjective test.
