excerpt: 'In most cases, speech and language technology is used for explicit interaction with computers. However, in a connected world the technology can also to be used for other purposes. It is the aim of this position statement to open research questions which point at the potential of speech and language technology for enabling new interaction experiences such as implicit interactions, body sensors, adaptive and persuasive interfaces. The research questions are grouped into three domains: user, system and context. In the user domain, our focus will be on information that can be extracted from the user. In the system domain, our focus in on crowdsourcing and privacy concerns. The focus point in the context domain is on implicit interactions and intelligent interactions.'

In most cases, speech and language technology is used for explicit interaction with computers. However, in a connected world the technology can also to be used for other purposes. It is the aim of this position statement to open research questions which point at the potential of speech and language technology for enabling new interaction experiences such as implicit interactions, body sensors, adaptive and persuasive interfaces. The research questions are grouped into three domains: user, system and context. In the user domain, our focus will be on information that can be extracted from the user. In the system domain, our focus in on crowdsourcing and privacy concerns. The focus point in the context domain is on implicit interactions and intelligent interactions.
