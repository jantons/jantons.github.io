excerpt: 'Out-of-home mobility, defined as active and passive movement through external environments, is a resource for autonomy, quality of life, and self-realization in older age. Various factors influence out-of-home mobility, primarily studied in urban settings. The study aims to examine associated factors in a study population aged 75 and above in rural areas. Baseline data from the MOBILE trial involving 212 participants aged 75 and above and collected between June 2021 and October 2022 were analyzed. Out-of-home mobility was measured temporally as time out of home (TOH) and spatially as convex hull (CHull) using GPS over seven days. Mixed models considered outpatient care parameters as well as personal, social, and environmental factors along with covariates such as age and gender. Participants in the MOBILE study (average age 81.5; SD: 4.1; 56.1% female) exhibited average out-of-home mobility of TOH: 319.3 min (SD: 196.3). Significant associations were found for age, social network, living arrangement, health literacy, sidewalk quality , green space ratio, outpatient care utilization, and active driving. Previously known multifactorial associations related to objectively measured out-of-home mobility in old age could be confirmed in rural areas. Novel and relevant for research and practice is the significant correlation between out-of-home mobility and outpatient care utilization.'

Out-of-home mobility, defined as active and passive movement through external environments, is a resource for autonomy, quality of life, and self-realization in older age. Various factors influence out-of-home mobility, primarily studied in urban settings. The study aims to examine associated factors in a study population aged 75 and above in rural areas. Baseline data from the MOBILE trial involving 212 participants aged 75 and above and collected between June 2021 and October 2022 were analyzed. Out-of-home mobility was measured temporally as time out of home (TOH) and spatially as convex hull (CHull) using GPS over seven days. Mixed models considered outpatient care parameters as well as personal, social, and environmental factors along with covariates such as age and gender.
