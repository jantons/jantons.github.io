excerpt: 'How quality, quality perception and emotions are related, and what this may imply for research on Q, is a question that to date still lacks an unambiguous answer. The study of this relationship is challenging and requires validated emotional stimuli as well as suitable methods and tools to evaluate their emotional impact. This paper shares findings from an inter-laboratory study (N=39), in which electroencephalography data and self-report data on experienced affect, content likeability and perceived quality were collected to evaluate the emotional impact of stimuli from a publicly available database aimed at evoking certain emotional responses. The results call for caution when evaluating emotional impact of such stimuli, as both the self-reported and EEG data point to a number of influencing factors that interfere with the emotion elicitation and need to be taken into account in future research.'

How quality, quality perception and emotions are related, and what this may imply for research on Q, is a question that to date still lacks an unambiguous answer. The study of this relationship is challenging and requires validated emotional stimuli as well as suitable methods and tools to evaluate their emotional impact. This paper shares findings from an inter-laboratory study (N=39), in which electroencephalography data and self-report data on experienced affect, content likeability and perceived quality were collected to evaluate the emotional impact of stimuli from a publicly available database aimed at evoking certain emotional responses. The results call for caution when evaluating emotional impact of such stimuli, as both the self-reported and EEG data point to a number of influencing factors that interfere with the emotion elicitation and need to be taken into account in future research.
