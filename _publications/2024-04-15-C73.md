excerpt: 'Inside-out tracking is growing popular in consumer VR, enhancing accessibility. It uses HMD camera data and neural networks for effective hand tracking. However, limited user experience studies have compared this method to traditional controllers, with no consensus on the optimal control technique. This paper investigates the impact of control methods and gaming duration on VR user experience, hypothesizing hand tracking might be preferred for short sessions and by users new to VR due to its simplicity. Through a lab study with twenty participants, evaluating presence, emotional response, UX quality, and flow, findings revealed control type and session length affect user experience without significant interaction. Controllers were generally superior, attributed to their reliability, and longer sessions increased presence and realism. The study found that individuals with more VR experience were more inclined to recommend hand tracking to others, which contradicted predictions.'

Inside-out tracking is growing popular in consumer VR, enhancing accessibility. It uses HMD camera data and neural networks for effective hand tracking. However, limited user experience studies have compared this method to traditional controllers, with no consensus on the optimal control technique. This paper investigates the impact of control methods and gaming duration on VR user experience, hypothesizing hand tracking might be preferred for short sessions and by users new to VR due to its simplicity. Through a lab study with twenty participants, evaluating presence, emotional response, UX quality, and flow, findings revealed control type and session length affect user experience without significant interaction. Controllers were generally superior, attributed to their reliability, and longer sessions increased presence and realism.
