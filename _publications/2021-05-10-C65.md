excerpt: 'Advancing technology and higher availability of Virtual Reality (VR) devices sparked its application in various research fields. For instance, health-related research showed that simulated nature environments in VR could reduce arousal and increase valence levels. This study investigates how the amount of possible interactivity influences the presence in nature environments and consequences on arousal and valence. After inducing fear (high arousal and low valence) through a VR-horror game, it was tested how participants recovered if they played a VR-nature game with either no, limited, or extensive interaction. The horror game proved to be a valid stimulus for inducing high arousal and low valence with a successful manipulation check. Igroup presence questionnaire (IPQ) scores showed that more interaction with the virtual environment increases spatial presence. A beneficial effect of experiencing nature can also be concluded. Results from the Self-Assessment Manikin questionnaire (SAM) scores for valence indicate a significant increase in the conditions with extensive and limited interaction compared to the control group. The VR Nature experience did significantly decrease arousal and increase valence compared to the post-horror game ratings. The physiological responses support this finding. These results can increase the effectiveness of health-related VR-applications to elevate mood levels by either implementing plenty of interactions and consequently increasing spatial presence or doing the opposite and leaving out any interactions at all.'
