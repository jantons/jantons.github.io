excerpt: 'This chapter gives an overview for Quality of Experience (QoE) practitioners on common setups in emotion research using audio (sounds), visual (pictures) and audiovisual (video clips) stimulus material to induce emotions. After presenting available databases for the different modalities, methods for subsequent as well as continuous self-assessment are discussed. Next to self-assessment, analysis of accompanying physiological changes is a common means to evaluate emotional responses. Here, typical measures of peripheral physiology are summarized. Finally, practical advices for including material with emotional content and recording physiological signals in experiments on audiovisual quality are given, and future research directions are outlined.'

This chapter gives an overview for Quality of Experience (QoE) practitioners on common setups in emotion research using audio (sounds), visual (pictures) and audiovisual (video clips) stimulus material to induce emotions. After presenting available databases for the different modalities, methods for subsequent as well as continuous self-assessment are discussed. Next to self-assessment, analysis of accompanying physiological changes is a common means to evaluate emotional responses. Here, typical measures of peripheral physiology are summarized. Finally, practical advices for including material with emotional content and recording physiological signals in experiments on audiovisual quality are given, and future research directions are outlined.
