excerpt: 'Studying cloud gaming QoE, we found the video compression bitrate and the played game level to significantly influence the system&apos;s feedback delay. We present a novel low-cost approach to accurately measure the latency between a user command and the system response using the popular Arduino microcontroller platform and conclude with lessons learned for future cloud gaming lab studies.'

Studying cloud gaming QoE, we found the video compression bitrate and the played game level to significantly influence the system&apos;s feedback delay. We present a novel low-cost approach to accurately measure the latency between a user command and the system response using the popular Arduino microcontroller platform and conclude with lessons learned for future cloud gaming lab studies.
